      "text": "One of the most intriguing sculptures is that of a giraffe—an animal not native to India. Its presence indicates knowledge of the animal even if it didn’t live here. Does it point to trade links with Africa? Probably yes. Imagine a trader explaining the long-necked creature to a sculptor, or perhaps an African trader gifted the animal."
